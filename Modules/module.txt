*  Modules are encapsulated units of code that can be reused across different parts of an application. 
   Modules help organize code into smaller, manageable pieces, promote code reusability, and facilitate better maintainability and scalability of NodeJS applications.

*  Types of Modules:

(1) Core Modules: Core modules are built-in modules provided by NodeJS.
                  They offer essential functionalities such as fs,os,http,path,crypto etc. 
                  

(2)Third-Party Modules:Third-party modules are created by the NodeJS community or external developers and are hosted on package registries like npm. 
                 Developers can install third-party modules using npm and include them in their applications using require().
                 for example : express,mongoose,jsonwebtoken,axios etc.

(3)Custom Modules:Custom modules are user-defined modules created by developers to encapsulate reusable code. 
                  Developers can create custom modules by defining functions, objects, or classes in separate files and exporting them using the module.exports or exports object.
                 

*Benefits of Using Modules:

Encapsulation: Modules encapsulate code, allowing developers to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces or functionalities.
Code Reusability: Modules promote code reusability by enabling developers to reuse modules across different parts of an application or in multiple applications.
Maintainability: Modular code is easier to maintain and refactor, as changes made to a module's implementation do not affect other parts of the application.
Scalability: Modules help organize code into smaller, manageable units, making it easier to scale applications as they grow in complexity.
